                <p class="bio">Software Engineer and former educator excited to bring solutions through technology.  Integrating e-learning apps in my classroom led to over 1.3 years in growth in reading and math, which  is no small feat.  Seeing the impressive results led me to join a SaaS edtech startup followed by a coding boot-camp to build my tech skills.  I want to bridge my experiences to develop and improve apps.</p>

Even after an exhausting day's work as an educator, Chase was both focused and active during project collaborative sessions.  His curiosity and flexibility allowed him to contribute to multiple project areas including curricula, EQ assessment, edtech, and user experience and user design. I can remember many times, Chase said, "Let's just get it done" during project meetings." -Mitch, CEO of STRUT Learning</p>
